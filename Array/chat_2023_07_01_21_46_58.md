The `map` function in JavaScript is used to transform elements of an array into a new array based on a provided callback function. It doesn't necessarily require an explicit `return` statement because it automatically returns a new array with the transformed elements.

Here's an example to illustrate how `map` works without an explicit `return` statement:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers);
```

In this example, the `map` function is used to create a new array `doubledNumbers` by multiplying each element of the `numbers` array by 2. The callback function `(num => num * 2)` is applied to each element of the `numbers` array, and the results are automatically collected into a new array.

The output of this code would be:
```
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Even though we don't explicitly use a `return` statement in the callback function, the `map` function handles the process of creating the new array and returning it.

However, it's important to note that if you need to perform more complex operations or modify the original array in-place, you may need to use an explicit `return` statement within the callback function.
