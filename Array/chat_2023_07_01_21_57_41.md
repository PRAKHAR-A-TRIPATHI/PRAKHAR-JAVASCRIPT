The `filter` function in JavaScript is used to create a new array containing elements from the original array that satisfy a specific condition. Like the `map` function, it doesn't require an explicit `return` statement because it automatically returns a new array with the filtered elements.

Here's an example to illustrate how `filter` works without an explicit `return` statement:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers);
```

In this example, the `filter` function is used to create a new array `evenNumbers` that contains only the even numbers from the `numbers` array. The callback function `(num => num % 2 === 0)` is applied to each element of the `numbers` array, and the elements that satisfy the condition (`num % 2 === 0`) are automatically collected into a new array.

The output of this code would be:
```
[2, 4]
```

Similar to `map`, even though we don't explicitly use a `return` statement in the callback function, the `filter` function handles the process of creating the new array and returning it.

However, if you need to perform more complex filtering logic or modify the original array in-place, you may need to use an explicit `return` statement within the callback function.

It's worth noting that the `filter` function doesn't modify the original array; it creates a new array with the filtered elements. This immutability is a key characteristic of functional programming concepts.
