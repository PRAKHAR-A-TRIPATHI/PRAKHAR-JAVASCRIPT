The `map` and `filter` functions in JavaScript are both array methods that operate on each element of an array and return a new array based on specific criteria. However, they serve different purposes:

1. `map`: The `map` function transforms each element of an array according to a provided callback function and returns a new array with the transformed elements. It creates a new array of the same length as the original array, where each element is the result of the callback function applied to the corresponding element of the original array. The original array remains unchanged.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(num => num * 2);

console.log(doubledNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, `map` is used to create a new array `doubledNumbers` where each element is the result of multiplying the corresponding element of `numbers` by 2.

2. `filter`: The `filter` function creates a new array containing only the elements from the original array that satisfy a specific condition. It tests each element of the array against a provided callback function and includes the elements for which the callback function returns `true`. The original array remains unchanged.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

In this example, `filter` is used to create a new array `evenNumbers` that contains only the even numbers from the `numbers` array. The callback function `(num => num % 2 === 0)` checks if each element is divisible by 2, and only the elements that satisfy this condition are included in the `evenNumbers` array.

In summary, the main difference between `map` and `filter` is that `map` transforms each element of an array, while `filter` selects elements based on a condition. `map` always returns an array of the same length as the original array, whereas `filter` can return an array with fewer elements if some do not meet the condition.

Both `map` and `filter` are powerful tools for working with arrays in JavaScript, and they can often be used together to perform complex transformations and filtering tasks.
