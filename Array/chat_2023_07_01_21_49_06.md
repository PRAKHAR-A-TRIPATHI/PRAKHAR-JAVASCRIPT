In JavaScript, functions can run without an explicit `return` statement for a few reasons:

1. Void Functions: Some functions are designed to perform actions or side effects rather than returning a value. These functions are commonly referred to as "void functions" or "procedures." They execute a sequence of statements or modify external state without producing a specific result. For example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John");
```

In this case, the `greet` function logs a greeting message to the console without returning any value. It simply performs an action.

2. Callback Functions: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, such as in the case of callback functions. These functions are invoked by the receiving function, and their execution may not require a return value. The receiving function can use the callback function to perform a specific task or operation. For example:

```javascript
function forEachElement(arr, callback) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    callback(arr[i]);
  }
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

forEachElement(numbers, function(num) {
  console.log(num * 2);
});
```

In this example, the `forEachElement` function accepts an array and a callback function. It iterates over each element of the array and invokes the callback function for each element. The callback function multiplies each element by 2 and logs the result. The callback function doesn't need to return a value because its purpose is to perform an action for each element, not produce a result.

3. Asynchronous Functions: JavaScript also supports asynchronous operations, such as making API requests or reading files. In these cases, functions often utilize callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax to handle the asynchronous nature of the operation. These functions may not require an explicit return statement because they handle the result asynchronously. For example:

```javascript
function fetchData(url, callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(function() {
    const data = { name: "John", age: 25 };
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData("https://api.example.com/data", function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

In this example, the `fetchData` function simulates an asynchronous operation by using `setTimeout`. After a delay of 2000 milliseconds, it invokes the callback function with some data. The callback function receives the data and logs it, without requiring a return statement.

It's important to note that while functions can run without an explicit `return` statement, they may still produce a value implicitly or modify external state. Understanding the purpose and behavior of a function is crucial in determining whether a `return` statement is necessary or appropriate.
